# 0. Instruction  

We open-source the data and code of our paper *Examining the Algorithmic Fairness in Predicting High School Dropouts* accepted by Educational Data Mining 2024. This project is based on the public version of a nationally representative dataset called *High School Longitudinal Study of 2009* (HSLS:09). You can find the detailed information [here](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/).  

  
The raw data can be accessed on NCES's [DataLab](https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/onlinecodebook/session/codebook/c48ab202-0e20-4537-9fbf-96d7d37afd55). Please click the download button on the right side of this webpage and choose the R version (i.e., in the `.rdata` format).  

The codebook and official documents are in the `04_files` folder.  

We welcome any comments, questions, and bug reports on this study. This current study is accepted as a short (less mature) paper rather than a full paper. We are currently working on the extension of it, and we hope to conduct a more comprehensive examination of the algorithmic fairness in High school dropout prediction.
